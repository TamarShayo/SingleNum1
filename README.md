Thank you,
I really enjoyed the exercise - it's definitely an interesting topic...
On the local machine it ran to me.i build and run the image.
During the deployment part it gets stuck on a security error.
I was looking for a solution to the problem of different structures of commands, login, logout, tokens,permissions etc.
But I did not succeed:(
